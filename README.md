# Python Flask App

## Description

This backend script powers a web application designed to work seamlessly with the [Realty Frontend](https://github.com/MrElementary/realty-web). The application enables users to log in, post properties for sale, and inquire about existing listings. Built with Flask, the backend integrates with a PostgreSQL database for the textual information and the images are stored using Cloudinary, with everything else hosted on Render.
